You want to know how\nmuch time you are spending on your projects? You want to generate a nice\nreport for your client? Watson is here for you.\n\n\nTell Watson when you start working on a task with the \nstart\n command.\nThen, when you are done with this task, stop the timer with the \nstop\n\ncommand. This will create what we call a \nframe\n. That\ns pretty much\neverything you need to know to start using Watson.\n\n\nEach frame consists of the name of a project and some tags. Your tags\ncan be shared across projects and can be used to generate detailed\nreports.\n\n\nWatson stores everything on your computer, but you can go wild and use\n\nartich.io\n to store\nyour sessions remotely and share it with your colleagues.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nWatson is available on any platform supported by Python (Windows, Mac,\nLinux, *BSD\u2026). The easiest way to install it is to use\n\npip\n:\n\n\n$ pip install td-watson\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your system, you might need to run this command with root privileges in order to install Watson globally.\n\n\nSingle user installation\n\n\nYou can choose to install Watson for your user only by running:\n\n\n$ pip install --user td-watson\n\n\n\n\nIf after this the \nwatson\n command is not available, you need to add \n~/.local/bin/\n to your \nPATH\n. If your terminal is Bash, you can do this by running:\n\n\n$ echo 'export PATH=\n$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\n' \n ~/.bashrc  # Add ~/.local/bin/ to your .bashrc PATH\n\n\n\n\nand restarting your terminal session or sourcing the \n.bashrc\n:\n\n\n$ source ~/.bashrc  # Reload your .bashrc\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment version\n\n\nThe latest development version can be installed using the following commands:\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson.git\n$ cd Watson/\n$ python setup.py install\n\n\n\n\nCommand line completion\n\n\nIf you use a Bash-compatible shell, you can install the \nwatson.completion\n file from the source distribution as \n/etc/bash.completion.d/watson\n - or wherever your distribution keeps the Bash completion configuration files. After you restart your shell, you can then just type \nwatson\n on your command line and then hit \nTAB\n to see all available commands. Depending on your input, it completes \nwatson\n commands, command options, projects, tags and frame IDs.\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nNow that \nwatson\n is installed on your system, let\ns start tracking your activity:\n\n\n$ watson start world-domination +cats\n\n\n\n\nWith this command, you have started a new \nframe\n for the \nworld-domination\n project with the \ncat\n tag. Time is running. Now, you need to work on your project. Let\ns do this. Now.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back! Now that your world domination plan has been set up, let\ns stop time tracking via:\n\n\n$ watson stop\nProject world-domination [cat] started 34 minutes ago (id: 166d1fb)\n\n\n\n\nTo list all available commands, either \nexplore the commands documentation\n or use:\n\n\n$ watson help\n\n\n\n\nWe hope you will enjoy Watson!",
