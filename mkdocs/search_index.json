You want to generate a nice\nreport for your client? Watson is here for you.\n\n\nTell Watson when you start working on a task with the \nstart\n command.\nThen, when you are done with this task, stop the timer with the \nstop\n\ncommand. This will create what we call a \nframe\n. That\u2019s pretty much\neverything you need to know to start using Watson.\n\n\nEach frame consists of the name of a project and some tags. Your tags\ncan be shared across projects and can be used to generate detailed\nreports.\n\n\nWatson stores everything on your computer, but you can go wild and use\n\ncrick.io\n to store\nyour sessions remotely and share it with your colleagues.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nWatson is available on any platform supported by Python (Windows, Mac,\nLinux, *BSD\u2026). The easiest way to install it is to use\n\npip\n:\n\n\n$ pip install td-watson\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your system, you might need to run this command with root privileges in order to install Watson globally.\n\n\nOn OS X, the easiest way to install Watson is using \nHomebrew\n:\n\n\n$ brew update && brew install watson\n\n\n\n\nDistribution packages\n\n\nYou can install Watson using available distribution packages.\n\n\nArch Linux\n\n\nA \nPKGBUILD\n file for building an Arch Linux package is available in the\n\nAUR\n. You can build and\ninstall it using the \nmakepkg\n\nor an \nAUR helper\n.\nPlease refer to the official documentation for more information on\ninstalling AUR packages.\n\n\nSingle user installation\n\n\nYou can choose to install Watson for your user only by running:\n\n\n$ pip install --user td-watson\n\n\n\n\nIf after this the \nwatson\n command is not available, you need to add \n~/.local/bin/\n to your \nPATH\n. If your terminal is Bash, you can do this by running:\n\n\n$ echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc  # Add ~/.local/bin/ to your .bashrc PATH\n\n\n\n\nand restarting your terminal session or sourcing the \n.bashrc\n:\n\n\n$ source ~/.bashrc  # Reload your .bashrc\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment version\n\n\nThe latest development version can be installed using the following commands:\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson.git\n$ cd Watson/\n$ python setup.py install\n\n\n\n\nCommand line completion\n\n\nBash\n\n\nIf you use a Bash-compatible shell, you can install the \nwatson.completion\n file from the source distribution as \n/etc/bash.completion.d/watson\n - or wherever your distribution keeps the Bash completion configuration files. After you restart your shell, you can then just type \nwatson\n on your command line and then hit \nTAB\n to see all available commands. Depending on your input, it completes \nwatson\n commands, command options, projects, tags and frame IDs.\n\n\nZSH\n\n\nIf you use zsh, copy the file \nwatson.zsh-completion\n somewhere in your\n\nfpath\n as \n_watson\n. For example, you can put it in\n\n/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions\n:\n\n\ncp watson.zsh-completion /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_watson\n\n\n\nMake sure that your .zshrc enables compinit:\n\n\nautoload -Uz compinit && compinit\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nNow that \nwatson\n is installed on your system, let\u2019s start tracking your activity:\n\n\n$ watson start world-domination +cats\n\n\n\n\nWith this command, you have started a new \nframe\n for the \nworld-domination\n project with the \ncat\n tag. Time is running. Now, you need to work on your project. Let\u2019s do this. Now.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back!
