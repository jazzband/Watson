You want to know how much time you are spending on your projects? You want to generate a nice report for your client? Watson is here for you. Tell Watson when you start working on a task with the start command. Then, when you are done, stop the timer with the stop command. This will create what we call a frame . That\u2019s pretty much everything you need to know to start using Watson. Each frame consists of the name of a project and some tags. Your tags can be shared across projects and can be used to generate detailed reports. Watson stores everything on your computer, but you can go wild and upload to your own crick server via the sync command to store your sessions remotely and share them with your colleagues. Installation Watson is available on any platform supported by Python (Windows, Mac, Linux, *BSD\u2026). The easiest way to install it is to use pip : $ pip install td-watson Depending on your system, you might need to run this command with root privileges in order to install Watson globally. On OS X, the easiest way to install Watson is using Homebrew : $ brew update && brew install watson Distribution packages You can install Watson using available distribution packages. Arch Linux A PKGBUILD file for building an Arch Linux package is available in the AUR . You can build and install it using the makepkg or an AUR helper . Please refer to the official documentation for more information on installing AUR packages. Single user installation You can choose to install Watson for your user only by running: $ pip install --user td-watson If after this the watson command is not available, you need to add ~/.local/bin/ to your PATH . If your terminal is Bash, you can do this by running: $ echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc # Add ~/.local/bin/ to your .bashrc PATH and restarting your terminal session or sourcing the .bashrc : $ source ~/.bashrc # Reload your .bashrc Development version The latest development version can be installed using the following commands: $ git clone https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson.git $ cd Watson/ $ pip install -e . Command line completion Bash If you use a Bash-compatible shell, you can install the watson.completion file from the source distribution as /etc/bash.completion.d/watson - or wherever your distribution keeps the Bash completion configuration files. After you restart your shell, you can then just type watson on your command line and then hit TAB to see all available commands. Depending on your input, it completes watson commands, command options, projects, tags and frame IDs. ZSH If you use zsh, copy the file watson.zsh-completion somewhere in your fpath as _watson . For example, you can put it in /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions : cp watson.zsh-completion /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_watson Make sure that your .zshrc enables compinit: autoload -Uz compinit && compinit Fish If you use fish, you can copy or symlink the file watson.fish from the source distribution to ~/.config/fish/completions/watson.fish . You may need to make the completions directory as it is not created by default. Once this is done, re-source your fish config: source ~/.config/fish/config.fish You will now have command completion for fish, including the completion of known projects, tags, and frames. Getting started Now that watson is installed on your system, let\u2019s start tracking your activity: $ watson start world-domination +cats With this command, you have started a new frame for the world-domination project with the cat tag. Time is running. Now, you need to work on your project. Let\u2019s do this. Now. Welcome back! Now that your world domination plan has been set up, let\u2019s stop time tracking via: $ watson stop Project world-domination [cat] started 34 minutes ago (id: 166d1fb) To list all available commands, either explore the commands documentation or use: $ watson help We hope you will enjoy Watson!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Watson is here to help you monitor your time.

Here\u2019s how to set up Watson for local development. Python requirements Python (2/3) interpreter installed pip tool to install package dependencies virtualenv tool to create virtual environments Get started! Fork the Watson repository on GitHub. Clone your fork locally: $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/Watson.git Create a virtual environment: $ cd Watson $ make env The Python version used will be the one accessible using the python command in your shell. To use a different Python version, define the PYTHON shell variable. For example: $ PYTHON=python3.5 make env Install dependencies and deploy Watson inside the virtual environment: $ source .venv/bin/activate (.venv) $ make install-dev If you are using fish shell, source .venv/bin/activate.fish instead. Create a branch for local development: (.venv) $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Now you can make your changes locally. Notes: The files you need to edit to change watson\u2019s behavior are located in the watson/ subfolder. Every time you run watson inside the virtual environment, the source code inside the watson/ subfolder will be used. To avoid messing with your real Watson data, watson will use data/ as the application folder inside the virtual environment.

By default, the project from the last frame, which was recorded, is restarted, using the same tags as recorded in that frame. You can specify the frame to use with an integer frame index argument or a frame ID. For example, to restart the second-to-last frame, pass -2 as the frame index. Normally, if a project is currently started, watson will print an error and do nothing. If you set the configuration option options.stop_on_restart to a true value ( 1 , on , true or yes ), the current project, if any, will be stopped before the new frame is started. You can pass the option -s or --stop resp. -S or --no-stop to override the default or configured behaviour. If no previous frame exists or an invalid frame index or ID was given, an error is printed and no further action taken. Example: $ watson start apollo11 +module +brakes Starting project apollo11 [module, brakes] at 16:34 $ watson stop Stopping project apollo11, started a minute ago. (id: e7ccd52) $ watson restart Starting project apollo11 [module, brakes] at 16:36 Options Flag Help -s, --stop / -S, --no-stop (Don\u2019t) Stop an already running project. --help Show this message and exit. start Usage: watson start [OPTIONS] [ARGS]... Start monitoring time for the given project. You can add tags indicating more specifically what you are working on with +tag . If there is already a running project and the configuration option options.stop_on_start is set to a true value ( 1 , on , true or yes ), it is stopped before the new project is started. If the \u2018\u2013no-gap\u2019 flag is given, the start time of the new project is set to the stop time of the most recently stopped project. Example: $ watson start apollo11 +module +brakes --no-gap Starting project apollo11 [module, brakes] at 16:34 Options Flag Help -g, --gap / -G, --no-gap (Don\u2019t) leave gap between end time of previous project and start time of the current. -c, --confirm-new-project Confirm addition of new project. -b, --confirm-new-tag Confirm creation of new tag. --help Show this message and exit. status Usage: watson status [OPTIONS] Display when the current project was started and the time spent since. You can configure how the date and time of when the project was started are displayed by setting options.date_format and options.time_format in the configuration. The syntax of these formatting strings and the supported placeholders are the same as for the strftime method of Python\u2019s datetime.datetime class. Example: $ watson status Project apollo11 [brakes] started seconds ago (2014-05-19 14:32:41+0100) $ watson config options.date_format %d.%m.%Y $ watson config options.time_format \"at %I:%M %p\" $ watson status Project apollo11 [brakes] started a minute ago (19.05.2014 at 02:32 PM) Options Flag Help -p, --project only output project -t, --tags only show tags -e, --elapsed only show time elapsed --help Show this message and exit. stop Usage: watson stop [OPTIONS] Stop monitoring time for the current project. If \u2018\u2013at\u2019 option is given, the provided stopping time is used. The specified time must be after the begin of the to be ended frame and must not be in the future. Example: $ watson stop --at 13:37 Stopping project apollo11, started an hour ago and stopped 30 minutes ago. (id: e9ccd52) # noqa: E501 Options Flag Help --at TIME Stop frame at this time. Must be in (YYYY-MM-DDT)?HH:MM(:SS)? format. --help Show this message and exit. sync Usage: watson sync [OPTIONS] Get the frames from the server and push the new ones. The URL of the server and the User Token must be defined via the watson config command.
